## Key features
- Contains a dataset of more than 13,000 texts that is gradually increasing in quantity and quality through contributions from core members and apps that use our APIs
- Uses the opf (OpenPecha format), which uses standoff markdown in annotation layers to link to characters in a base text layer
- Includes a base layer, a table of contents layer, a footnotes layer, and a hyperlinks layer by default
- Supports virtually unlimited additional layers for witnesses, commentaries, layers of same-type tags, and more
- Supports changes to the base layer through OpenPecha's Character Coordinate Translation Vector (CCTV), which locks tags in annotation layers to characters in the base layer even as they move
