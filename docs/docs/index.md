OpenPecha is a free open repository of e-texts and annotations made publicly available on GitHub and through a set of APIs. The projectâ€™s primary aim is to facilitate the collection, proofreading, and enrichment of e-texts by leveraging language technology and collaboration.

Our dataset is gradually increasing in quantity and quality through direct contributions from core members and from apps that use our APIs.
